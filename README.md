# Introduction and planing

I started to plan according to my figjam, I went to colors.so to check some contrasts and how the colors fit together. The color theme on the website was already ready in Figjam, because my daughter had to decide the colors.

I like that there is some space between the sections and text so I started planning some different spacing I wanted to work with on the page

I decided to use 2 css files, one for the main css, where I commented when the section starts and ends so it should be easy to find. And a page for root and media queries.

I thought of having a page for home, about, project and contact.

then with the passage of time you had to re-plan and make a few changes here and there but I thought it went quite smoothly

I also planned how I would bring everything required for the grade. and I thought I got everything in smoothly so over time everything fell into place.

For example, I used React components and Props for the Card function.

Implement React Router to be able to navigate between pages in app.jsx

useState Hook: I used for the html, css, javaScript and React navigation and also for the hamburger menu.

Redux: I used it when I wanted to change the theme between light and dark with the lamp in the middle.

and to be able to get VG, I then chose to change the theme because it was one of the examples to be able to get VG
